Apple finally got on board the wireless charging train. Beginning with the iPhone 8 and iPhone X, Apple added wireless charging to the iPhone.

Wireless chargers tend to come in two different variants: stands and pads.

A pad is a good idea for your bed-side table or lying on your desk, but there are times when a stand makes more sense. 

Stands are useful for iPhones with Face ID, and to work on your phone while charging.
