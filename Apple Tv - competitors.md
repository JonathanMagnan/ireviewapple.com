The Amazon Fire TV plays the role of an influencer when the time comes to chose a movie or a tv show. 

In other words, the menus are strongly geared toward showing Amazon Prime videos and contents. 

However, you will be able to find Netflix programming if you have a subscription apart. 

Just like the Apple TV+, the Fire TV Stick makes it a great option for a second TV or those with a Full HD resolution. 

However the streamer doesn't offer a 4K resolution. 

[The subscription starts at $39,99/year](https://www.amazon.com/subscription-Network-Kitchen-additional-auto-renewal/dp/B086PHBT95)
