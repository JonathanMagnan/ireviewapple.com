The Amazon Fire TV plays the role of an influencer when the time comes to chose a movie or a tv show. 

In other words, the menus are strongly geared toward showing Amazon Prime videos and contents. 

However, you will be able to find Netflix programming if you have a subscription apart.

However the streamer doesn't offer a 4K resolution.
