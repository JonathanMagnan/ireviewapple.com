The Amazon Fire TV plays the role of an influencer when the time comes to chose a movie or a tv show. 

In other words, the menus are strongly geared toward showing Amazon Prime videos and contents. 

However, you will be able to find Netflix programming if you have a subscription apart. 

Just like the Apple TV+, the Fire TV Stick makes it a great option for a second TV or those with a Full HD resolution.

- No 4K resolution
- Not a friendly interface
