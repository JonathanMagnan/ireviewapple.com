The original Apple TV includes a full-blown app store, an integration with Siri for a voice-recognition to search and command operation, and finally, a new remote control with a touchpad.

The Apple TV has the simpliest design of any streaming video box, with a small white light on the front that is turned on when the streamer is used. 

Even if the remote is included, you can control it with an iPad or iPhone using Apple's Remote app.

The debut of Apple TV 4K makes the streaming TV market more competitive. This new device has the ability to display videos in 4K and HDR.

This 4th generation relies on Siri; you can use voice or text to search for content on any compatible apps (including Netflix, Hulu, Crackle, Spotify and Pandora, as well as a plethora of network-specific apps from Fox, ABC, CBS, FX, HBO, Starz and others).

What is more remarkable, is that the Apple TV also functions as a shopping device with the apps you can download for stores that are integrated with Siri.
