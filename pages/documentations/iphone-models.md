Even if Apple doesn't offer this version, the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus have been one of the most appreciated phone created by Apple. 

They have the capacity to pack a ton of good features, including blazing fast processors, as well as a solid cameras, and wireless charging.

The graphic image and stereo speakers that are now 25% louder make it more enjoyable to watch videos or play games. 

Also, with a bigger and faster sensor, the 12-megapixel camera on noth iPhones takes great photos.

Hopefully, this iPhone is still available with or without a phone carrier.

Known as *the first of a new generation*, The iPhone X remains a strong device even if it's no longer available at Apple. 

Its new style designed (without the icon feature; the home button) was one of the first eye catchy change.

Also, the edge-to-edge screen is more clear and neat that supports HDR in iTunes and Netflix.

The iPhone X was a celebration of 10 years of the iPhone and it's still available with or without a phone carrier.

Over the years Apple has tried to ace the camera quality.

The iPhone 11 is often recommended by *artists* since it is known for the camera improvement with its new ultrawilde angle.

The night mode helps with better indoor shots, faster autofocus and overall sharper images with more accurate color reproduction.

Essentially, the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro are 85% the exact same phone. 

However, if you are looking for a phone that dedicates all its capacities to the camera, well the "Pro" is the one!

The 3 cameras at the back of the phone offers 2x optical zoom, different size options, a better screen and finish.

The iPhone XR remains a great value, especially if you want a bigger screen.

It has a fast enough performance processor as well as a good camera quality in a colorful design.

The single rear camera offers excellent performance and impressive portraits.

It is one of the most affordable iPhone still available at Apple.
