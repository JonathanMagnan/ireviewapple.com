#iPad Air

The regular iPad and the iPad Air offer a similar design. However, there are differences under the hood.
For starters, the iPad Air is compatible with a various range of accessories, including the Apple Pencil.
The iPad Air is thinner, more powerful, and has a bigger screen and has a resolution of 2,224 x 1,668.

#iPad mini

The iPad mini is appealing for its size since it is small enough to be carried in a bag. 
Also, It has a 7.9-inch screen, weighs 0.66 pounds, and measures less than a quarter of an inch thick. 
The iPad mini is also remarkable for its power as strong as the regular models.   
However, the Mini version doesn't support Apple's Smart Keyboard.



#iPad Pro 

As stated in the name of this model, the Pro version includes the most significant changes Apple has made to its tablets in years. 
This advanced model of iPads runs very smoothly, along with its high-performance gaming and video editing. 
Furthermore, it has a USB-C instead of Lightning, Face ID instead of Touch ID, and the device is more portable.
