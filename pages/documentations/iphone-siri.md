Since you have an iPhone, you have probably met Siri, Apple voice assistant. 

At the time of its release with the iPhone 4S, Siri was THE biggest technology revolution of 2011.

Despite the dilemma regarding the *privacy issue*, Siri has functions that will not cross that line. 

The catching phrase *Hey Siri* will automatically hook this assistant attention by replying *what can I help you with? *

## Researches

Whether it's for general knowledge or specific information, Siri has the capacity to browse the internet and get back to you. 

All you have to do is to say one of the 5 W's (what, where, when, who & why). 

For instance, you can ask Siri the following questions:

- To find out what movies are playing and how they are rated

- To Identify the song that's playing

- To find and launch apps

- **To search for photos by time or location**

## Mark an event or meeting on your calendar

You can ask your assistant to schedule an appointment for you, by including the date and time.

To help you keep track of your journey, this event will also show up on your notification center.

**key word**: *Hey Siri add call with mom tomorrow at 4 PM*

## Edit an event or meeting on your calendar

Not only can Siri take appointments or sets alarm for you, but you can also ask to cancel or modify them. 

If you have more than one even matching your request, Siri will go the extra mile by confirming what alarm you meant.

**key word**:  *Change my Tuesday appoint at 2 o'clock to 230*

## Set a reminder

To keep you organized, Siri can also create a time-based reminder. As simple as it might sound, all you must do is say out loud what you want to be reminded about, and when.

**key word**:  *Remind me tomorrow at 10 a.m. to call my travel agent. *

Also, Siri has the ability to add reminders to specific lists by simply naming the list.

**key word**: *Add yogurt to my shopping list*

## Set an alarm or timer

If you want to keep track of your oven or to time a test, Siri can help you count down a few minutes or a few hours by asking her to "set time".
Also, Siri gives you the option to check the time left by saying, “Check timer.”, or to cancel it “Stop timer.”

**key word**: *Start timer for 15 minutes*

## Take notes

This Apple creation can transcribe your words into texts by simply dictating it. Apple improved this task by allowing Siri to find them and edit them as well. 
However, the *only* task that Siri will not perform will be to delete the note; you will have to do it manually.

**key word**: *Take note*

## Content reminder

Siri also can remind you of things you saw. Once you say *remind me of this*, this innovative assistant will add it to Reminders with a link back to not only the app but also the specific content.
