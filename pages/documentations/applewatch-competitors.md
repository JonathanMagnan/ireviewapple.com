# Competitors to the Apple Watch Series 3

The Apple Watch has become one of the most popular smartwatches available, particularly for iPhone users. But it is not the only smartwatch around. 

Many polls concluded that Series 3 is one of the most impressive watches on a technology level, as well as a price range. 

However, different companies tried to perfect the watch, and here is the lookalike Series 3:

# Casio Pro Trek Smart Outdoor Watch

This line of watches is excellent for outdoor activities. However, its capacities are limited. 

Compared to Apple, Casio doesn't offer the basic activity tracker, such as the heart rate, Active Minutes, and Calories Intake Burned.

The model Versa from Fitbit and Apple are both strong smartwatches that have the capacity to keep an eye on your health and fitness. 

However, if you are planning on leaving your phone while doing outdoor activities, it is not an option with Versa because of its lack of GPS. 

Regarding the storage, the Fitbit has 2.5GB of storage set aside for music, while the Apple Watch has 8GB for music on the LTE model (2GB if you have a non-LTE version).

# Fossil Q

Like the Apple Watch, Fossil Smartwatches offer fitness tracking, BUT it has to be paired with your phone in order to function. That said, you will always have to rely on your phone to stay connected. 

The watch kind of loses it's credibility and becomes an *ordinary watch* when it's not connected. 

# Samsung Gear S2

The strongest rival of the Apple watch would be the Samsung version. The Galaxy Watch is compatible with both android and iOS, while the Apple Watch can only be used with an iPhone. 

Samsung and Apple have taken different approaches to Smartwatches design; Samsung has a traditional round while Apple has a squarish stainless steam model.
