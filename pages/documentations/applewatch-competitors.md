However, if you are planing on leaving your phone while doing outdoors activities, it is not an option with Versa because of its lack of GPS.

As the Apple watch, Fossil Smartwatches offer fitness tracking BUT it has to be paired with your phone in order to function. That said, you will always have to rely on your phone in order to stay connected. 

The watch kind of looses it's credibility and becomes an *ordinary watch* when its not connected. 

# Samsung Gear S2

The strongest rival of the Apple watch would be the Samsung version. The Galaxy Watch is compatible with both android and iOS, while the Apple watch can only be used with an iPhone. 

Samsung and Apple have taken different approaches to Smart watches design; Samsung has a traditional round while Apple has a sqaurish stailess steam model.
