Apple Siri, Amazon Alexa, and Google Assistant are all getting better at understanding and answering questions. However, all those digital helpers have their strengths, weaknesses, and limits.  

They can tell you about the weather, play music, tell you the news and control your smart home devices hands-free.

Considering itself as *a research-driven venture capital firm based in Minneapolis and New York investing in frontier tech companies*, Loup Ventures put to the test these technologies. 

During the Annual Digital Assistant IQ Test of August 2019, the company asked the same 800 questions and shared the results:

# Amazon Alexa

### Supports over 20,000 smart home devices

Alexa is the voice-controlled Amazon assistant that turns words into actions.

This Amazon assistant had the capacity to control compatible smart home devices, control music, run timers, reminders, and alarms, find information online, play content on an Amazon Fire device, and obviously calling.

Despite of being able to send voice messages and call other Alexa devices, it cannot send text messages or emails. 

# Google Assitant

Google Assistant is probably the smartest and most dynamic of the personal assistants.

This assistant will allow you to control compatible smart home devices, control music, access information from your calendars, act as a translator in real-time, run timers, alarms, and reminders.

You can also find information online and play content to a Chromecast device. Google Assistant is very impressive since it can handle multiple queries at once.

However, Siri continues to prove more useful with phone-related functions like calling, texting, emailing, calendar, and music.
