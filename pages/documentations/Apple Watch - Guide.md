# Set a passcode

The Apple Watch doesn't require a passcode. However, it's necessary if you want to use Apple Pay.

The passcode will be created on your iPhone during the setting process. What's intersting with the passcode is  that you won't have to enter the code every single time you want to use the Watch.
