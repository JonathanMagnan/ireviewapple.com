# How to connect your Pencil to your iPad?

Before starting to use the digital pencil, you will have to configurate it. 
That said, both generations **pair differently**.

## First Generation

```
1. Make sure the iPad you want to use is on and unlocked, then uncap your Pencil.
2. Plug in your Pencil to the new iPad.
3. When the Bluetooth Pairing Request appears, tap Pair.
```

## Second Generation

```
1. Make sure the iPad you want to use is on and unlocked.
2. Place the Apple Pencil on the wide side of the iPad Pro with the magnetic strip.
3. Tap Pair when the Bluetooth Pairing Request appears.
```

# Apple Pencil battery

Unlike other accessoires from Apple, the Pencil doesn't have a physical charge indicator or LED light on its body.
That said, here are the steps to check its current battery life.

## First Generation

```
1. Swipe down from the iPad's screen to invoke Notification Center (or turn the iPad on to view the Lock screen).
2. Swipe right to see the Widgets screen.
3. View the Batteries section.

``` 

## Second Generation

```
For the second generation it is possible to check the battery level in two ways.
First, you can follow the steps above for the first-generation Apple Pencil.
Second, you can place it on the magnetic charging strip on the iPad Pro. A notification will pop up and show the current battery percentage.
```

# How to charge Apple Pencil

Before turning of, the Pencil will naturally give you a charge warning. 
Here are the different steps to charge each generation:

## Second Generation 

For this generation, Apple made it easier to charge. **There's only one way.**

Simply place the Pencil on the wide side of the iPad Pro with the magnetic strip.

It will take up to 30 minutes for the digital pencil to be fully charged.
