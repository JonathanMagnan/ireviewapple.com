# Touch ID

Touch ID is a fingerprint authentication first seen on the iPhone5.

It is know as the built-in privacy system for unlocking your device and authorizing Apple Pay.

You can register up to five fingerprints on the MacBook Air or MacBook Pro, with a maximum of three fingerprints per user account.
